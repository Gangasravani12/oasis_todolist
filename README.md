The provided code creates a simple to-do list web application. The HTML structure consists of an input field, an "Add" button, and a task container. The CSS styling offers a clean interface with rounded corners and a pleasant color scheme. Font Awesome icons are integrated for better user experience.

When the "Add" button is clicked, the JavaScript code inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener is executed. It retrieves the task name from the input field. If the input is empty, it shows an alert. If a task name is provided, it dynamically adds a task element within the task container. Each task includes the task name and a delete button with a trash icon.

Event listeners are attached to the delete buttons. When a delete button is clicked, it removes its corresponding task element from the list.

The code ensures that the input field is cleared after adding a task.

In summary, the code combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create a functional to-do list application. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The interface is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, allowing for efficient task management.
